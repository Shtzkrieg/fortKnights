#### Statement of purpose

* To find the perfect path wherein a group of 1-4 fortnite players can maximize the efficacy with which they steamroll 8 year olds on a path to victory, thereby discouraging underage players from spending time on fortnite, lowering amount said 8 year olds spend on fortnite, until ultimately the game itself becomes financially unsustainable for any developer, fortnite is taken off the market, and this very app obsolete
